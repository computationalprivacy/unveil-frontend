This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Terminal View - react custom components
[react](https://reactjs.org/)

# Map - react-leaflet & OSM based

Requirements for the map:
1. Free = open source
2. Popular = has many tutorials and examples, has been around for long
3. Can create customizable markers, can use JSON file info to create them, dynamic
4. Dynamic - can change the content in real time (zoom, map shown)
5. Many plugins,  flexible
6. Simple - -high level API, easy to start a project with
7. Speed- vector/  raster

After checking different options (Google maps, Plotly, Kepler, Open Layers, MapBox), chose [[leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.3.2.html)]. 


## Leaflet Plug-Ins

1. [react-leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/en/) an abstraction of Leaflet as React components.
2. [react-leaflet-markercluster](https://github.com/MazeMap/Leaflet.LayerGroup.Collision) for clustering markers in maps. Group multiple markers to one, and in MainMap shows the sum of users in all that clusters. 

## General Resources

1. [Adobe Color Scheme](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/)
